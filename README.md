# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, and age.  
Built using Python and the **PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset**.

---

## 📘 Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of **Logistic Regression** to solve a real-world healthcare classification problem.  
It includes steps like data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)  
- **Samples:** 768  
- **Features:** 8  
- **Target:** 0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## 🚀 Model
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression  
- Accuracy: ~78% on test data  
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

---

## 📈 Results
The model performs well in identifying diabetes cases and can be improved using ensemble models and hyperparameter tuning.

---

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add feature importance visualization  
- Implement other algorithms (RandomForest, XGBoost)  
- Deploy on Streamlit for interactive predictions
